## Hi there 👋

I'm Rayed, a Computer Science student based in Lahore, Pakistan.

I enjoy solving problems using Machine Learning and related to Machine Learning. 

I have experience in finetuning ML models, making them from scratch, and compressing them for edge-aware solutions. 

My Senior Year Project, which I am currently working on, solves image and video deterioration due to rain or rain streaks in particular, using concepts in Computer Vision and Deep Learning.

I'm currently learning full stack web development by building an AI powered note taking web app with 4 team members, it is pinned in my projects below.


I have pinned my favourite projects below, but my favourite among those is [LLM compression and deployment on an edge device](https://github.com/ryder-4/Llama-3.1-8B-Compression-and-Deployment-on-Raspberry-Pi-4).


You can contact me on my email:
